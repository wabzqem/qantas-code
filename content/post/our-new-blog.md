The aim for the blog is to share technical insights into the interesting work being built everyday by the Qantas tech teams. We’ll be covering a wide range of topics from people, processes and ethics through to deep-dives into technical disciplines like performance, scale, machine learning and our venture into the world of AR.

We’ve gained so much from the tech community, it’s time for us to give back.
