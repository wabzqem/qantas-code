Seventeen years ago in Utah seventeen men returned from the Wasatch mountains not with ten commandments but with the four tenets of agile software development, **[the Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/)**: 

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools;
* Working software over comprehensive documentation;
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation; and
* Responding to change over following a plan.

These modern day tech prophets had news to share and their original philosophy has spawned agile factions, evangelists and many consultants. However, as with many doctrines before it, the core message of the Manifesto is often lost.

Agile software development began as a desire to deliver working software incrementally and to continually adapt to customer needs quickly. The methodology is supported by **[twelve principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)**:

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.

8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

10. Simplicity — the art of maximizing the amount of work not done — is essential.

11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

Over time the documented values and principles of agile have been misinterpreted, misunderstood and merged with other methodologies. One such conflation has resulted in “iterative waterfall” or “wagile” delivery.

This fusion of practices has led to the misuse of terms like minimum viable product (MVP) to describe the delivery of fixed requirements over a fixed timeline to a fixed cost; and agile ceremonies are used as an overt demonstration of an organisations agile credentials: we do stand-ups therefore we’re agile.

### **_So how can we change it?_**

**[Tom Wujec’s marshmallow challenge](https://www.ted.com/talks/tom_wujec_build_a_tower)** shows how Kindergarten kids are intuitively agile in their thinking and I believe software engineers are too. Continually building, testing and learning (and accepting that failure is a part of that learning) is key for a successful outcome and good software engineers know this.

Agile delivery removes the silos from the software development lifecycle (SDLC) by combining the phases of analysis, design, build and test into shorter iterations or sprints. By reducing the length of the SDLC working software can be delivered rapidly while accommodating the inevitability of changing requirements.

As engineers we first need to dispel the myth that waterfall delivery gives certainty. Agile recognises the uncertainty in all software development projects. Understandably, organisations need to plan product roadmaps, but publishing a delivery date doesn’t necessarily make it achievable. An iterative agile approach can help by highlighting a delivery risk early in a project.

Agile was built for flexibility and should be interpreted through the lens of your own organisation’s delivery needs but without losing sight of agile values. When collaborating with product teams engineers can influence technical solutions and enable the release of new MVP features to customers as they’re built. Why wouldn’t we want to add value to a product early, learn from our customers and change requirements in real time before the finished product is delivered?

It’s also important to not to conflate processes and outcomes. It’s crucial that organisations undergoing agile transformations embed the values of the manifesto before delivering on its principles. Ceremonies and processes like stand-ups, retros and sprints can support agile delivery but they’re not compulsory or even essential, however working software (the 2nd value of the manifesto) is.

When the now-famous agile visionaries left their mountain retreat they may have expected their simple methodology to be reinterpreted and evolve, but did they envisage that their manifesto would be misappropriated and give birth to the Book of Wagile?
